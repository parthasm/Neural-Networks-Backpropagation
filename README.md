# Neural-Networks-Backpropagation

This neural networks implementation is coded in Python using the numpy package. 
The back propagation and feedforward algorithms have been implemented as a part of this classifier.
It uses a single hidden layer. It runs on the processed Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.
The processing consists of removing rows with missing values and the row ids in the beginning of the rows.

For details on the dataset, see the names file in this repository.

This neural network classifies a tumor as malignant or benign. 
The classifier is trained on the dataset and the accuracy is reported on the training set.
